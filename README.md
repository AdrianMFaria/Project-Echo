# Bioacoustics-Classification-Tool
Capstone Project (A) - Bioacoustics Classification Tool

Welcome all - lets use this repo to track tasks, projects, issues, and store all the code. If you are unfamiliar with github feel free to contact me or any other student who is confident with the use of the repo and we can walk you through the basics. For those who are familiar, lets make sure all your commits are well commented, code is clear and well structured. 

The projects page will allow the team to monitor everyones progress, as well as allowing you to add visual aids to your OnTrack uploads to show progress in the project. Once our topic is apprived, lets split off into component groups (AI/ML devs, data scientiscs, researchers...) and define individual roles and tasks.
