# Project Echo - A bioacoustics classification tool ðŸ¤–

We are excited to announce that Project Echo has made significant progress towards our vision of developing an AI/ML solution for understanding the density and classification of noise-producing animals in rainforests. Our goal is to provide conservationists with an efficient and non-destructive tool for tracking threatened animal species population numbers over time.

We have successfully created a complex audio pipeline that can take in any audio file of any type, file size, and format and convert it to tensor Mel spectrogram file ready for training. We have also trained an efficient net_v2 pre-trained model on images with 7.1 million parameters for 224x224 images and attained an impressive accuracy of 90%.

To make our solution more accessible, we have developed a publicly facing pip package that developers can use to load our pre-trained model and pass it raw audio files in a live environment. Additionally, we have developed a prototype API for a website, which can be used to upload a sample audio file and receive predictions for animal classification.

We believe that sound analysis can revolutionize the way we monitor animal populations, and we aim to make our solution widely available to conservationists and researchers. Our solution leverages machine learning to understand the density and classifications of animals in a survey area, using our curated sound datasets. Our team is making solid and comprehensive progress in the analysis of labeled data and its predictive ability using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Project Echo is dedicated to providing conservationists with the best possible tools to protect and preserve endangered wildlife and minimize the impact of predatory and other destructive fauna. We believe that sound analysis can unlock new insights into animal populations and are excited to continue our progress towards our vision.
