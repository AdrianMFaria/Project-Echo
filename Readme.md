# Echo Components for Kubernetes

Welcome to this repository! This repository contains all the essential components for our project, along with the necessary Kubernetes configurations. These configurations encompass deployment files, service files, volume claims, secrets, and config maps.

## Understanding the Kubernetes Landscape

Before diving into this repository, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with some key Kubernetes terminologies:

1. **Pods**: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They are a group of one or more containers that share storage and network resources.

2. **Deployments**: Deployments allow you to describe an applicationâ€™s life cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pod replicas, and the way to update them.

3. **Services**: Services enable network access to a set of pods. They provide a stable endpoint for accessing your application, even if the underlying pods change.

4. **Volume Claims**: PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) are used to request storage resources from a storage class. This allows pods to have access to persistent storage.

5. **Secrets**: Kubernetes Secrets are used to store sensitive information like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. They provide a way to secure your applications and decouple sensitive information from your container images.

6. **Config Maps**: ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.
