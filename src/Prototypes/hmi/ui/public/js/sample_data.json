            "summary": "Zanda funereal, commonly known as the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, is a large bird species found in the forests of southeastern Australia. It is known for its striking appearance and unique vocalizations, as well as its important role in the ecology of its native habitat.",
            "description": [
                "The species is one of the largest cockatoo species, with adults measuring up to 65 cm in length and weighing up to 900 g. It has a distinctive appearance, with black feathers covering most of its body, a bright yellow patch on its tail feathers, and a large, strong beak that it uses to crack open seeds and nuts.",
                "Yellow-tailed black cockatoos are social birds and are often seen in pairs or small groups. They communicate with each other using a range of vocalizations, including a loud, distinctive call that is often heard in the early morning and late afternoon.",
                "The species is found in a range of forest habitats, including wet and dry eucalypt forests, rainforests, and woodlands. It is most commonly found in areas with mature trees that provide food and nesting sites, and it feeds on a range of seeds, nuts, and fruits.",
                "Yellow-tailed black cockatoos are monogamous breeders, and pairs remain together for life. Breeding occurs between June and January, with females laying one to two eggs in a hollow in a tree trunk. Both parents incubate the eggs and care for the young.",
                "The species is considered to be vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human activities such as logging and land clearing. It is also threatened by the loss of mature trees, which provide important nesting sites and food sources."
